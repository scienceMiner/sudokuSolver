# FischerRandom Generator

Generates all 960 Fischer Random Chess Openings

The rules for a Fischer Random Board are:

  1.  All remaining white pieces are placed on the first rank.
  2.  The white king is placed somewhere between the two white rooks.
  3.  The white bishops are placed on opposite-colored squares.
  4.  The black pieces are placed equal-and-opposite to the white pieces. 
  For example, if white's king is placed on b1, then black's king is placed on b8.
  
 This process simply outputs all 960 varations in list form.
